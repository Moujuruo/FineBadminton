Bottom continuously compressed Top's reaction space with delicate net shots and placements, ultimately securing victory with a textbook-level net shot on the 10th stroke. Top attempted to reverse the disadvantage through tempo changes in passive situations but exposed weaknesses in stability during crucial points. It is recommended to improve the success rate of net shots under passive conditions.",

Bottom relied on quick starts and precise backcourt smashes to pressure Top's backhand, with the decisive moment being a straight smash from the overhead area followed by a net rush. Top managed to cover wide ranges to defend multiple crises but lost the final point due to a mishit caused by off-balance overhead swing, highlighting the need to strengthen core strength training.",
      "C. This round showcased a classic defensive counterattack pattern. Bottom proactively employed deep drop shots to create counter opportunities under Top's continuous high-pressure attacks, breaking the balance with an accurate overhead cross-court slice on the 8th stroke. Although Top resolved six crises with defensive consistency, the final point was lost due to insufficient deception after a retrieval, allowing the opponent to predict and intercept the shot. Improving high clear stability is recommended.",

Bottom adopted a conservative transition strategy in the first six strokes, then suddenly accelerated to rush the net on the 7th stroke, forcing Top into a passive net error. Top attempted to disrupt with cross-court placements but suffered three consecutive low clears, ultimately losing due to a misjudged net shot that went wide, exposing weaknesses in shot selection under passive score differences."
